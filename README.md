> **If a slab is mapped to the wrong block, please report it on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dooji2/unslab/issues).**

> In a future update, you will be able to manually exclude/fix mappingsâ€”although it would still be appreciated to report it so it works out of the box for everyone! It should work with most slabs, modded and vanilla.
